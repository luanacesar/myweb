# My web

This is my personal website that I created to show all the skills that I learned from college. I have had this website for over a year. In the my skills section I show the coding languages that I have learned and in the ongoing courses section, I show the skills that I am currently learning. Since I have graduated, I have been learning new IT languages and frameworks. My next update is going to be all the online extra courses that I am taking on Udemy, LinkedIn learning and more. Under the footer area, I list my contact and social media information. I developed this website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and GitHub. To see more, please click on the links below.</br>
